## Code Availability Notice
At present, we are unable to release the source code publicly. We have received notice from a company asserting that portions of our work may overlap with their patents related to viewport-dependent streaming. In light of this potential legal issue, we cannot make the code or scripts openly available.

The authors, however, remain open to technical discussions and are willing to provide clarifications regarding the implementation through academic or professional exchange.
